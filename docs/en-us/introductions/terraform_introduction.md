# Terraform Introduction

## What is Terraform

Terraform is an open-source IT infrastructure orchestration management tool that supports using configuration files to describe individual applications or entire data centers. Through Terraform, you can easily create, manage, and delete Huawei Cloud resources and version control them.

## Advantages of Terraform

### 1. Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure can be described using high-level configuration syntax, making infrastructure codeable and versionable, enabling sharing and reuse. Main advantages include:

- Version Control: Infrastructure code can be included in version control systems
- Reusability: Configuration templates can be reused across different environments
- Standardization: Ensures consistency in infrastructure deployment

### 2. Execution Plans

Terraform has a "plan" step that generates an execution plan.
The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call apply, allowing you to avoid unexpected results when Terraform operates on infrastructure. It also allows operators to confirm that changes meet expectations.

### 3. Resource Graph

Terraform builds a dependency graph of all resources, bringing the following advantages:

- Parallel Operations: Can create and modify non-dependent resources in parallel
- Efficient Construction: Optimizes the order of resource creation and modification
- Dependency Management: Operators can clearly understand dependencies in infrastructure

### 4. Change Automation

Supports automated application of complex change sets with the following characteristics:

- Minimize Human Intervention: Reduces the need for manual operations
- Error Prevention: Avoids human errors through execution plans and resource graphs
- Consistency Guarantee: Ensures predictability and repeatability of changes

## Application Scenarios

1. **Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Quickly deploy complete infrastructure environments
   - Ensure consistency across multiple environments (development, testing, production)
   - Simplify resource configuration and management processes

2. **Multi-Cloud Management**
   - Unified management of resources across different cloud platforms
   - Standardize multi-cloud deployment processes
   - Simplify cloud resource migration and synchronization

3. **DevOps Practices**
   - Support infrastructure as code development patterns
   - Seamless integration with CI/CD processes
   - Promote collaboration between development and operations

4. **Resource Orchestration**
   - Manage complex resource dependencies
   - Automate resource creation and configuration
   - Ensure correct order of resource deployment
