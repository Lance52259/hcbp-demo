# Introduction

## What is Cloud Bastion Host (CBH)

Cloud Bastion Host (CBH) is a security operation and maintenance management service provided by Huawei Cloud, offering enterprises a unified security operation and maintenance entry point. CBH helps enterprises establish secure and compliant operation and maintenance management systems through centralized identity authentication, permission management, and operation auditing.

CBH supports multiple protocols (SSH, RDP, VNC, etc.), providing fine-grained permission control, complete operation auditing, and real-time monitoring capabilities. Through CBH, enterprises can achieve unified management of operation and maintenance personnel, complete recording of operation behaviors, and real-time alerts for risk behaviors, effectively improving operation and maintenance security and compliance.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Cloud Bastion Host (CBH), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud CBH resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for CBH resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated CBH deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent cloud bastion host management and operation work.
