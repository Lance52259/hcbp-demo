# Introduction

## What is Elastic Cloud Server (ECS)

Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) is a fundamental computing component composed of CPU, memory, operating system, and cloud disks. As one of Huawei Cloud's core services, ECS provides scalable, high-performance computing resources, supporting multiple specification families and operating systems to meet the needs of different application scenarios.

Through ECS, you can quickly deploy applications and services in the cloud just like using your own local servers, enjoying the advantages of cloud computing such as elastic scaling, pay-as-you-go, high reliability, and security. Huawei Cloud ECS supports seamless integration with VPC, security groups, cloud disks, and other services, providing you with complete cloud solutions.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Elastic Cloud Server (ECS), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud computing resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for Elastic Cloud Server resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated ECS deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent ECS management and operation work.
