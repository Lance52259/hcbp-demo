# Introduction

## What is Cloud Desktop (Workspace)

Huawei Cloud Cloud Desktop (Workspace) is a cloud computing-based desktop virtualization service that provides enterprise users with secure and convenient cloud office solutions. It supports multiple operating systems such as Windows and Linux, provides flexible billing modes and rich terminal access methods, helping enterprises quickly build secure and efficient remote office environments.

Through cloud desktop, you can achieve centralized data storage and lightweight terminals, allowing users to securely access cloud office desktops from anywhere through various terminal devices. Huawei Cloud Cloud Desktop supports seamless integration with VPC, security groups, cloud disks, and other services, providing you with a complete cloud office solution.

Huawei Cloud Cloud Application is an important component of the Workspace service, providing enterprises with cloud deployment, management, and delivery services for applications based on cloud-native architecture. Cloud application services support centralized application management, secure and controllable access permission control, cross-platform compatibility, and elastic scaling capabilities, helping enterprises achieve unified application management and cost optimization.
