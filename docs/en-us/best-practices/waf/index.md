# Introduction

## What is Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a one-stop security protection service provided by Huawei Cloud for Web applications, which can effectively defend against various Web security threats such as SQL injection, XSS cross-site scripting, web trojan upload, command injection, malicious crawlers, CC attacks, and more. It supports cloud mode and dedicated instances (Professional Edition), meeting enterprise-level high-performance and compliance requirements.

Through WAF, you can build multi-layered security defenses for websites and Web applications, ensuring business availability, security, and compliance. Huawei Cloud WAF supports seamless integration with CDN, ELB, API Gateway, and other services, providing you with a complete Web security solution.
