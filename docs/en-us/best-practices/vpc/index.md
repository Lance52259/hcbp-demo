# Introduction

## What is Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated network environment provided by Huawei Cloud for users, supporting custom subnets, routes, ACLs, and other network resources, meeting enterprise-level network security and flexible networking requirements.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud VPC, helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud network resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for network resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated VPC deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent VPC management and operation work.

## Best Practices List

This section contains the following best practices:

* [Deploy Basic VPC Network](basic.md) - Introduces how to use Terraform to automatically deploy basic VPC and subnets.
