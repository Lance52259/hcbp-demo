# Introduction

## What is Auto Scaling (AS)

Auto Scaling is a service that automatically adjusts computing resources. It can automatically adjust the number of elastic computing instances based on business needs and policies, ensuring you have the right amount of computing resources to meet business requirements. Through Auto Scaling, you can dynamically adjust resources based on business load, reducing operational costs while ensuring service quality.

Auto Scaling supports automatic scaling based on multiple metrics, including CPU utilization, memory usage, bandwidth, etc., and is suitable for various scenarios such as website services, big data analysis, and gaming services. It provides intelligent resource scheduling and balancing capabilities, supports cross-availability zone deployment, and can seamlessly integrate with ELB to achieve traffic distribution and instance health checks.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Auto Scaling (AS), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud Auto Scaling resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for Auto Scaling resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated Auto Scaling deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent scaling group, scaling policy management, and operation work.
