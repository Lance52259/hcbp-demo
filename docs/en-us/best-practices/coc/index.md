# Introduction

## What is Cloud Operations Center (COC)

Cloud Operations Center (COC) is a one-stop operation and maintenance management platform provided by Huawei Cloud, offering enterprises a unified operation and maintenance management entry point. COC helps enterprises achieve automated operation and maintenance and intelligent management through script management, task scheduling, monitoring and alerting, improving operation and maintenance efficiency and quality.

COC provides complete operation and maintenance lifecycle management functionality, supporting multiple script types and task execution methods, with high reliability and security. Through COC, enterprises can easily achieve operation and maintenance automation, ensure stable business operation, and reduce operation and maintenance costs and risks.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Cloud Operations Center (COC), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud operation and maintenance resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
